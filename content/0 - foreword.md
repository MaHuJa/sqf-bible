SQF is our name for the scripting language used in the Arma series of games by Bohemia Interactive, as well as its spinoff VBS. 
It doesn't have an official name, but the file extension .sqf has been used since the language we recognize today first appeared in Arma: cold war crisis: resistance in july 2002.

This 'book' will all be focused on Arma 3, the latest iteration of the series. SQF is an important part of most user generated content for the arma series of games. Without it you can make something that looks different from what exists, but works generally the same. For example, a new gun model, a new uniform, a car. To make it actually do something different, you need to tell the game what else it should do. Telling a computer what to do is known as programming. Don't be deceived by the label "scripting language". SQF is a domain-specific dynamically typed operator-based procedural programming language for the Arma platform.

And my aim is to teach you everything you need to know to use it to its limits. 

Up till now there has been no comprehensive guide to sqf. There's probably nobody, even at BI, who actually knows the whole thing - which is why I will be bringing in more contributors. There are a number of tutorials for the basics of the language, but then you're largely on your own. And there's a lot of traps people then get caught in. Only by repeated personal failure could you learn, and become a veteran. The opportunity to learn from others' experience has been limited.

Once you know a bit of the language, it may be worth looking into other programming skills: Version control (e.g. git) is an essential tool, project planning/architecting, etc. "The pragmatic programmer" is one of the classic books for a programmer who has gotten a bit of experience with at least one language.

At some point in arma's history (in the spinoff "Take on Helicopters") there was an experiment with using Java to script the game, instead of sqf. Except that one release, "take on java", which was overall a failure, it has barely been mentioned since. So we're likely stuck with SQF for a long time.
