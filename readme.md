Once the manw deadline is over, I'll be trying to get the community together to make what BI could not provide.

The ability to make quality scripts are concentrated in far too few people.
The necessary documentation ''kinda'' exists out there, but nowhere can you get a comprehensive guide. 
There may be nobody, even at BI, who has the full set of knowledge.

Many who are trying to get something working won't even know programming, so this guide will start at the basics of programming.

This guide will only cover individual commands as necessary to teach the concepts, but will instead have links relevant commands on the biki.

Contributing:

Contributions should be made in the same format I make my pages in.
I have not yet decided what format that will be, however it will be something text-editable, 
ruling out microsoft word, libreoffice writer, and their html outputs, pdf, and similar. 

The guide as a whole should be published under something like cc-by-sa, possibly gnu fdl.
Commercial use is allowed for two reasons: BI should be able to use it, and anyone can freely make it into a book and recoup the costs.
I hope to be paid in the form of better user generated content.
