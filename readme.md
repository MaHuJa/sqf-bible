Once the manw deadline is over, I'll be trying to get the community together to make what BI could not provide.

The ability to make quality scripts are concentrated in far too few people.
The necessary documentation ''kinda'' exists out there, but nowhere can you get a comprehensive guide. 
There may be nobody, even at BI, who has the full set of knowledge.

Many who are trying to get something working won't even know programming, so this guide will start at the basics of programming.
